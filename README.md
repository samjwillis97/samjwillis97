### Hey There ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self taugh software developer from Newcastle, NSW, Australia. By day I'm working as a Mechanical Engineer at Verico Asset Integrity Services in Warabrook and by night expanding my knowledge into software development.

A few years ago whilst still studying at university I found a passion for software and technology in general and since then have been teaching myself and trying out a variety of languages with particular interest in both front-end and back-end development.
