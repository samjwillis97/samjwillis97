### Hey There 👋

I'm a Mechanical Engineer from Newcastle, NSW, Australia with a passion for Software Development and continuously improving my knowledge base.

A few years ago whilst still studying at university I found my passion for software and technology in general and since then have been teaching myself and trying out a variety of languages with particular interest in both front-end and back-end development.]
